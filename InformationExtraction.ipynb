The same thing happens if I go through every objects and first get the type of the object (which is actually a lamp), but the console shows up an error message showing that for example spot radius or anything else is not an attribute of a \"Blender Object\". In the previous case I have explained that the Python doesn't realize that a \"Blender Lamp\" is actually a \"Blender Object\", but \"Blender Lamp\"s should also keep their original properties inherited from \"Blender Object\"s as I think. Because in Blender, whatever type an object has, it has a position rotation, scale and etc. So far, as you know every lamp has position (like objects have) and also light properties (light color etc.) But if I would like to get the position of a Blender Lamp, it doesn't work, because it shows that kind of a lamp is not an object but in Blender a lamp also have location and everything like normal objects. I also didn't find references to positions of lights in Blender 2.49 python api documentation.</p>\n",
